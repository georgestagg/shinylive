// This script is meant to be executed with Deno, not Node.js!
//
// It converts a file containing codeblock content, to a JSON file containing an
// array of FileContent objects. Reads from stdin and writes to stdout.
//
// Usage:
//   deno run codeblock-to-json.ts
//
// Deno can run Typescript directly, but we are still running it through esbuild
// to generate JS because we want to bundle other files into it. If we didn't
// bundle the files, we would need to do some weird stuff with paths for the
// import to work at run time, because the output path structure is different.
